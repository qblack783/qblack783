- Hi, I’m Que and I am currently a chemical scientist. Nice career but it's not exciting like tech.
- I’m interested in creating an app and to have fun with some cool projects.
- I’m currently learning python and SQL.
- I’m looking to collaborate and meet people in this space.
- I am looking for a job where I can use these skills and work for a start up company or a larger company.
- My goal is to work hybrid or remote in the world of coding whether that's back end, front end, data scientist, or in software enginnering.
